      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Pariyatti exists to bring people into contact with the teachings of the
        Buddha. We provide resources in the Theravāda tradition, and support
        Pāli language students and Vipassana meditators, in the tradition of
        Sayagyi U Ba Khin as taught by S.N. Goenka. We serve meditators,
        scholars, educators and the public by providing ready access to
        hard-to-find titles, a large collection of online resources,
        pilgrimages, and Pāli workshops.
